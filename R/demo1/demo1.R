# I. Here you can
# 1. import necessary R packages for your prediction
# 2. load your own files containing trained models, engineered features, extra data etc. for prediction
# 3. set some global constants

# Note:
# 1. You should put your used files in the same folder as this R file
# 2. When load files, ALWAYS use relative path such as load("model1.RData")
#    DO NOT use absolute path such as load("C:/Users/Peter/Documents/project/MSBD/model1.RData")

# II. Here are your predictions

# Note:
# 1. Need to add necessary comments to help us understand your program. 
#    MUST give the description of inputs and outputs of functions as the following example. 

# 2. The prediction should OUTPUT the data dataframe with 4 new columns (must saved in following column names!)
#   1) winprob: winning probabilities of horses
#   2) plaprob: top-three probabilities of horses
#   3) winstake: betting ratios of the bankroll on horses to be winners
#   4) plastake: betting ratios of the bankroll on horses to finish within top three places


# Here you should explain the idea of your predictions briefly in the form of R comment.
# You can also attach related files such as a document & image & table in your team folder to show your idea

# The idea of this sample prediction:
# 1) make use of rating (column rating) of horses to predict winning probabilities of them 
# 2) then use the Plackettâ€“Luce model to transfer winning probabilities to top-three probabilities
# 3) fix a stake and bet by finding merits based on odds 5 minutes before the start of matches
